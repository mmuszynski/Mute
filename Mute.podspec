There is no native iOS API to detect if the mute switch is enabled/disabled on a device.

The general principle to check if the device is muted is to play a short sound and detect the length it took to play.
From this length we can determine if it was muted or not.

This library is a Swift variant of https://github.com/moshegottlieb/SoundSwitch.
